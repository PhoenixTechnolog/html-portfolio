<h2>My Top 3 MOvies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Platform</h3>

<p>This movoie showcases the greed that rich or powerful individuials have. This is a movie prisoners who are fed on a decending platform.
Those on the upper levels take more than their share and thus the lowest levels receive nothing. It is a deep psychological thriller.</p>

<h3>Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs</h3>

<p>This is a cartoon. Its silly but shows a real life perspective that if foof can be manufactured in seconds and fell from the sky, 
most of us would only eat junk food.</p>

<h3>Die Hard</h3>

<p>I think this is a severely underrated action movie. In my opinion this is the best Christmas movie without all the jazz of an unrealistic world showcasing 
a happy ever after. It has some comedy but its full action. </p>
